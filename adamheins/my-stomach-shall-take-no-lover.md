# My Stomach Shall Take No Lover
A Petrachan sonnet by Adam Heins

Would I take you or just a plate of food?  
You please my eyes with beauty rivaled not,  
Your skin so smooth as if from china wrought,  
Your voice so sweet as if with harp imbued,  
Such radiance your sparkling face exudes,  
Your hair so smooth it is by angels sought,  
For you Aphrodite holds jealous thought,  
So lovely that by all you are pursued.  

But alas my heart belongs to cuisine:  
Smitten, I am, with chops of lamb so lean,  
My love is given to succulent steak,  
For prized pork and pies of pear I ache,  
The rapture of eating a piece of cake  
Is always better than lover's heartache.
