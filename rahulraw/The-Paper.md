# The Paper
## A poem by Rahul Rawat about the educational system

A clean sheet--
Blank and tended to
With the edges corenated
Ready to be filled
 
A fine sheet
With the margin 
Pink
With the blues 
Across
 
A ready sheet
Made of fresh pulp 
Ready to enclose
[ the secret of the universe ]
 
A mistaken sheet
 
The etching; not text
The engravings; not ink
 
I was murdered
 
Written on 
Again and again
The writing expanded --
But I did not
 
I'm blotted black and blue
The graphite and ink disect 
The wisdom I had percieved to have
 
The text goes downways
The text goes diagonally
The text; a scrambled egg
 
The secret of the universe:
Is a black hole.
 
With no heads or tails 
Of the mess
I am crumbled and tossed
Only to be picked up 
- And written on again
