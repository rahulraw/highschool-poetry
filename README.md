# Highschool Poetry
We all had to take English class in highschool. At some point you probably
wrote a poem or two. It can be pretty amusing looking back at these. Go ahead
and post your old highschool poems here for others to see!

## Posting
1. Post your poems in a plain text format if possible. I like markdown, myself.
2. Put them in a directory with the same name as your GitHub username. This
   keeps things neat.
3. Submit a PR with your poems and I'll accept it.
